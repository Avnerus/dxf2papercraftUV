What is required by dxf2papercraft?
-----------------------------------

The executable binary version of dxf2papercraft have been linked
statically to omit problems with the dime library. If you want to
compile dxf2papercraft from the sources you need to install the dime
library.

On Ubuntu or Debian to following should do:

sudo apt-get install libdime libdime-dev

For other distirbutions, please use your respective packet
manager. You can also compile the included version of dime from
scratch:

tar xzf dime_0.20091127.tar.gz
cd dime
./configure --enable-static
make
sudo make install

How to install dxf2papercraft?
------------------------------

If libdime has been installed as described above you only need to
compile the project with

make

and run the application from the current directory (no installation
required).

As a first test you may want to convert one of the examples

./dxf2papercraft ./examples/mycubes.dxf ./testsheet.dxf

Open the resulting cutout-sheet, e.g., with

ooffice testsheet.dxf

if you have OpenOffice installed. You can also use qcad
<www.ribbonsoft.com> (rather use your packet manager) or other
applications which can import 2D DXF files.
